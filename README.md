# Newspaper-Article-Classification-Model

Created a newspaper article classification model within Python. Utilized popular text preprocessing and feature engineering techniques including lemmatization and label encoding to prepare text, before inputting them into logistic regression machine learning model to correctly predict and classify newspaper article categories based on its headline and description.  

## Purpose of the Project
Newspaper articles and reporters alike utilize this technology on a broader scale to classify newspaper articles for more successful reaches to the right audiences.  

## Skills Demonstrated
Skills Used: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Python Scikit-Learn  

## Dataset Used
One dataset was used for this project. It contains information regarding newspaper articles, but the key ones used include 'headline', 'short_description' and 'category'.
